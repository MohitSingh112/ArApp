# 📱 ARApp — Drill Placement in Augmented Reality

**ARApp** is an Android application that uses **ARCore** and **SceneView** to let users practice object placement drills in Augmented Reality. Users can select from three drills (Basic, Advanced, Expert), each with a unique 3D model that can be placed on detected surfaces using their device's camera.

## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 **Surface Detection**: Automatically detects horizontal planes.
- 🎯 **Drill Marker Placement**: Tap to place drill markers on detected planes.
- 🧱 **Model Variants**:
  - 🟥 **Cube** for Basic Drill
  - 🟩 **Cone** for Advanced Drill
  - 🟦 **Sphere** for Expert Drill
- 💡 **Tips and Instructions**: Contextual drill tips and placement instructions.
- 🔁 **Replace Placement**: Tap again to move the drill marker to a new location.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the code into your Android Studio project.
2. Create the following directory and place your 3D models:

app/src/main/assets/models/
├── cube.glb
├── cone.glb
└── sphere.glb

## 📦 Dependencies

In your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
implementation("com.google.ar:core:1.41.0")
implementation("io.github.sceneview:arsceneview:0.10.0")
Gradle Plugin (Kotlin DSL):

kotlin

plugins {
    alias(libs.plugins.android.application)
    alias(libs.plugins.jetbrains.kotlin.android)
}
🎮 How to Use
Launch the app.

Select a drill from the dropdown:

Drill 1: Basic Placement (Cube)

Drill 2: Advanced Placement (Cone)

Drill 3: Expert Placement (Sphere)

Read the instructions.

Tap Start AR Drill.

Move your phone slowly to detect a horizontal surface.

Tap to place a marker.

Tap again to move the marker to a new location.

🌐 Fallback Models
If the app fails to load the local .glb model, it fetches a fallback from the Khronos glTF Sample Models repository:

Box.glb → Cube

Cylinder.glb → Cone

Sphere.glb → Sphere

🛠️ Troubleshooting
✅ Make sure Google Play Services for AR is installed and updated.

✅ Grant Camera Permission at runtime.

✅ Only run on physical Android devices (not emulators).

🔄 If models aren't showing:

Double-check file names: cube.glb, cone.glb, sphere.glb

Verify they are in src/main/assets/models/
